# Is it a Corporation? Is it a Colony? It's StarCo!

Not quite sure what this is yet, but you'll be able to roam the galaxy and build an empire.

Core mode of game play will be a real-time production point accumulation based. You can then quickly spend points to do stuff.

## When will this be ready?

No idea.

## Will this be multi-player?

Maybe - don't know yet. Maybe if I can get a host somewhere and a decent comms infrastructure.

## Can I contribute?

In principle, yes. In practice, I don't even know what I'm doing yet, so I don't know how that would work :P
